<p>CBTA offers competitive fees and speedy services for attorneys in need of immigration-related consultations. We do thorough and professional evaluations that yield comprehensive psychological reports for use in filings. Our reports offer expert opinions in these matters.</p>
<p>In the past, our clinical interviews have helped clients in cases involving:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extreme Hardship evaluations: Documenting the practical, financial and emotional consequences of family separation and its psychological consequences and nature of the hardship to the petitioner.</li>
    <li>Forgiveness evaluations: Documenting the practical, financial and emotional consequences of the family members continued absence from the United States due to being barred from reentry.</li>
    <li>Asylum cases: Documenting the psychological impact of past persecution and/or fear of future persecution if the petitioner is returned to their country of origin.</li>
    <li>Spousal/partner abuse and violence (VAWA) cases: Documenting the psychological impact of the abuse suffered whether it is abuse of a physical, sexual, emotional or financial nature.</li>
    <li>For U-Visa cases: Establishing the impact of the violent crime the petitioner was exposed to and the effect it has had on them.</li>
</ul>  


<p>We can only do evaluations of petitioners who are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Located in Massachusetts at the time of the video interview.</li>
    <li>Are age 12 or over with the consent of their parent.</li>
</ul>

<p>We offer to testify to our reports, but there is an additional fee to stand by for telephonic  testimony, or to physically appear in court for your case.</p>
<p>We work closely with you and your client.</p>
<p>Please note: We do not do evaluations for medical certification of inability to take the citizenship examinations, or people who are out of state at the time of the evaluation.</p>
